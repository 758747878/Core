    <td><h3>Earth's inner core is the innermost geologic layer of the planet Earth. It is primarily a solid ball with a radius of about 1,220 km (760 mi), which is about 20% of Earth's radius or 70% of the Moon's radius. Temperature in the inner core is about 5,200° Celsius (9,392° Fahrenheit). The pressure is nearly 3.6 million atmosphere (atm). The temperature of the inner core is far above the melting point of iron. However, unlike the outer core, the inner core is not liquid or even molten.Inner core is hotter than the Outer core</h3>
